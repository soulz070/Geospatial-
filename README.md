## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into global attitudes toward cryptocurrencies by analyzing Twitter data. Additionally, it visualizes cereal yield data to understand global agricultural productivity trends. The geographical distribution of opinions on cryptocurrencies is explored, highlighting regional differences and similarities.

## Data Sources
The analysis uses the following datasets:
- **Cereal Yield Data**: Obtained from the World Bank, containing cereal yield (kg per hectare) data for various countries.
- **Population Data**: Also from the World Bank, used to contextualize cereal yield data.
- **Bitcoin Tweets**: A dataset of tweets mentioning Bitcoin, used to gauge public sentiment on cryptocurrencies.

## Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas geopandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soulz070/Geospatial.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd crypto-cereal-analysis
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook st20257754_CIS7030_WRIT_1.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The notebook provides the following results:
- A detailed analysis of global attitudes towards cryptocurrencies based on Twitter data.
- Choropleth maps visualizing cereal yield per hectare for the years 2019 and 2020.
